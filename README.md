Default community health files for all repos in the PyMC-devs GitHub org. They will be used by GitHub for all repos, unless there's a file with the same name (e.g. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in reponame/.github/.

See [About default community health files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization) for more details.
